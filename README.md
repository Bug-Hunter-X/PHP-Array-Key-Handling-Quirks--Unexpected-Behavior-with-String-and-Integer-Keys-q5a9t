# PHP Array Key Handling Quirks

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common issue in PHP related to how it handles array keys, especially when mixing string and integer keys.  The problem arises from implicit type conversions that can lead to unexpected results.

The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected and more robust approach.  The issue centers around the assumption that string keys always behave predictably.  However, in certain contexts, they are treated as integers, affecting the array structure and values unexpectedly.

The primary issue is the behavior of incrementing a string key that's implicitly converted to an integer.  This can lead to data loss or unexpected modifications to the array.
